# The Sovereign Legal Identity Challenge

**Teams participating in the Legal Hackers 2018 [Computational Law and Blockchain Festival] are encouraged to develop a project that addresses the following design and rapid prototype challenge:**

Develop a conceptual design and rapid prototype demonstrating how individuals can use blockchain technology to generate, use and control their own digital identities.  

The conceptual design should include an outline or sketch of a realistic approach to deployment and stable operation of the identity system, including a:
* Business model;
* Legal framework; and
* Technology architecture

The rapid prototype should demonstrate how the identity system enables an individual to execute digital signatures or provide other authorizations necessary for conducting one or more legally valid and enforceable transactions, such as: 

* Signing and enforcing contracts and other legal instruments;
* Registering and holding trademarks or copyrights;
* Sending and receiving binding legal notices; and
* Standing as a candidate or voting in local elections

## Participation

Teams participating in the Computational Law and Blockchain Festival that wish to address this challenge may do so by registering their project and team through a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/mitmedialab/SLIC/issues).  

## Criteria

Teams are expected to:

* Pitch their project idea at or before the start of the 2018 CL+B Fest through a 2 minute or shorter video clip uploaded to YouTube under Creative Commons license;
* Present their final project in a 2 minute or shorter video clip uploaded to YouTube under Creative Commons license;
* Provide their final project materials (including any slides, video and other media, documentation, working code, etc) through a GitHub repository under an open source license;
