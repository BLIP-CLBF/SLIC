# The Sovereign Legal Identity Challenge

**Teams participating in the Legal Hackers 2018 [Computational Law and Blockchain Festival] are encouraged to develop a project that addresses the following design and rapid prototype challenge:**

## Conceptual Design

Develop a conceptual design and rapid prototype demonstrating how individuals can use blockchain technology to generate, use and control their own digital identities.  

The conceptual design should include an outline or sketch of a realistic approach to deployment and stable operation of the identity system, including a:
* Business model;
* Legal framework; and
* Technology architecture

## Rapid Prototype 

The rapid prototype should demonstrate how the identity system enables an individual to execute digital signatures or provide other authorizations necessary for conducting one or more legally valid and enforceable transactions, such as: 

* Signing and enforcing contracts and other legal instruments;
* Registering and holding trademarks or copyrights;
* Sending and receiving binding legal notices; and
* Standing as a candidate or voting in local elections

# Criteria and Judging

Teams are expected to:

* Present their final project in a 2 minute or shorter video clip uploaded to YouTube under Creative Commons license;
* Provide their final project materials (including any slides, video and other media, documentation, working code, etc) through a GitHub repository under an open source license.

Final team projects will be reviewed and rated by a panel of invited judges.  Evaluation criteria will be added to this challenge page after an initial meeting of the judges and prior to the start of the CL+B Festival event.  The top team projects will be determined based on rank order resulting from an aggregate of the ratings by each judge.  The team submitting the top ranked, highest rated project will be invited to present the project in-person at MIT to interested students, faculty and researchers.
